### About this config
I previously used NvChad, but I found it to be too complex for my needs. That's why I decided it was a great moment to create my own config for NeoVim. It runs faster than typical popular builds because I have limited the features to only what is necessary for my purposes.
I'm a FullStack Developer specializing in Frontend (React, tailwindcss), Node.js, and Typescript. Inside, you will find all the necessary plugins and settings.

### Why it's public
I believe that you don't necessarily have to use this config as is, as you can create a similar config that is tailored specifically to your needs. However, if you are transitioning from VS Code or another common editor to NeoVim, this config can serve as a helpful reference for you.
